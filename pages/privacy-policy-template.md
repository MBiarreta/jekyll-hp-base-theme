# Privacy policy template
Your users need to know how their personal data is being handled. There are logs capturing activities and you might also have Google Analytics or similar running.

To make it simple we have added a layout called `standardPrivacy`. 

{: .notification .is-primary }
The privacy template it not ready for usage yet and it will always be your responsibility that it is correct.
