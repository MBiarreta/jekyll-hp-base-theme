# Privacy policy template
Your users need to know how their personal data is being handled. There are logs capturing activities and you might also have Google Analytics or similar running.

To make it simple we have added a layout called `standardPrivacy`. 

{: .notification .is-primary }
GBIF provide a privacy policy as a template for you, and you need to complete a few configuration parameters.
Please be aware that while we provide this template, and believe it to be reasonable, it is your responsibility - the service agreement (yet to be shared) will indicate this. You can overwrite the template similar to any other file in your portal.
