# Documentation
The documentation is a bit fragmented, you will find some in this project and other parts in the [hosted portals repo](https://github.com/gbif/hosted-portals). It is also worth looking at [the issues](https://github.com/gbif/hosted-portals/issues) for that project, you might be lucky that your question already have an answer. And finally there is the [mailing list](https://lists.gbif.org/mailman/listinfo/hosted-portals)

## How to configure your site

Many questions are best answered by the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/), but questions that are specific to the theme or the widgets will be documented in this repository.

The portals and search widgets is still under development, so this document will change as we progress.
